# Lazy loading
 solves the problem of unnecessary loading of resources, such as images or scripts, which can slow down page rendering and degrade user experience. By loading these non-critical resources only when they are needed, lazy loading enhances performance, reduces initial loading time, and conserves bandwidth.

 This technique reduces the initial load time by splitting the code into smaller chunks, allowing only the necessary code for a particular part of the application to be loaded when needed.
